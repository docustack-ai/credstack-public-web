## Refund and Cancellation Policy
At credstack, we strive to provide the best service possible to our valued customers. This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions under which refunds will be provided for our services.

**Monthly Subscriptions**
If at anytime during your first month using our service you are dissatisfied, please contact us. We will do our best to address your issue, provide a work around or give a timeline for a solution that will meet your needs. If you are not satisfied, we will consider a pro-rated refund or your purchase.

**Annual Subscriptions**
credstack doesn't force you into an annual subscription as a condition to use our services. We prefer to give you the flexibility to choose. In exchange for you signing up for an annual up-front commitment, we offer you a significant discount over the already-low monthly subscription cost. If at anytime during your first 45 days using our service you are dissatisfied, please contact us. We will do our best to address your issue, provide a work around or give a timeline for a solution that will meet your needs. If you are not satisfied, we will gladly offer you a pro-rated refund for your purchase.

We want you to be happy with our service throughout your entire contract, not only the first 30 days (in case of monthly subscription) and the first 45 days (in case of annual subscription). So we go beyond that. If at anytime during your contract we remove, break or discontinue functionality that was available at the time you signed up for our services , we ask you to notify us immediately. If we fail to address the breakage of a functionality within any promised timelines , or if we are unable to provide a satisfactory work around for discontinued functionality, we will offer you a pro-rated refund for the reminder of your contract.

**Partial Downgrade of Annual Subscription**
There may be situations where you wish to partially downgrade your annual subscription. Partial downgrade occurs if, during your annual subscription period, you reduce the number of user licenses, downgrade the edition of our services, downgrade your paid support plan or remove an add-on that you had previously purchased. In case of partial downgrade of annual subscription, you will be provided credits in the form of extension of subscription for the active licenses. The discounts that were applied will be excluded for calculating the quantum of credits, i.e., the value for the un-used license = total amount paid - (monthly list price x number of months used).

**Auto-Renewal**
For your convenience, your monthly and yearly subscriptions will auto-renew until you cancel the service. Every time before your subscription auto-renews, we will send a mail specifying the amount that will be charged to your credit card. Similarly, after each renewal we will send you a receipt via e-mail specifying the amount that has been deducted together with the next renewal date and the next renewal amount.

**Exception to our Refund Policy**
There will be strictly no refund (FULL OR PRO-RATED) in cases where your account is terminated or suspended or blocked by credstack for activities that are in violation of our Terms of Service including, but not limited to phishing, impersonation, fraud, and violation of any applicable laws.
