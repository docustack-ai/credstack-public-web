**Definition:** As per [RBI’s 2025 Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf), a Co-Lending Arrangement (CLA) is “an arrangement, formalised through an ex-ante agreement, between a regulated entity (RE) originating the loans (‘originating RE’) and another RE co-lending (‘partner RE’), to jointly fund a portfolio of loans…in a pre‑agreed proportion, involving revenue and risk sharing”. In effect, banks and NBFCs pool funding on each loan, sharing both advances and credit risk (this echoes [RBI’s earlier definition of co-origination](https://fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RBI-05-11-20-Co-Lending-by-Banks-and-NBFCs-to-Priority-Sector.pdf)). The new framework applies uniformly to all eligible loans (secured or unsecured) and all participating lenders under RBI’s ambit (broadening earlier priority-sector-only rules).



## Updated RBI Co-Lending Framework (Directions 2025)

The 2025 Directions (effective January 1, 2026, with earlier adoption allowed) replace the 2020 priority-sector circular. They set out detailed norms for bank–NBFC co-lending. Key provisions include:

 **Applicable Entities:** All commercial banks (except Small Finance Banks, RRBs, Local Area Banks), All-India Financial Institutions, and all NBFCs (including HFCs) can enter CLAs ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Effective Date:** Directions take effect from Jan 1, 2026 (or an earlier date as per an institution’s policy) ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Board Policies & Agreements:** Each RE must have a board-approved co-lending policy (covering portfolio limits, target borrowers, partner due diligence, etc.) ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)). Co-lending partners enter a Master Agreement detailing terms, borrower selection criteria, product lines, fees for lending services, allocation of roles, timelines for data-sharing, and customer interface/grievance mechanisms ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Loan Documentation:** Every loan agreement must upfront disclose which RE is the point-of-contact and how roles are split (sourcing, servicing, etc.) ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)). All key CLA details (e.g. each partner’s share, blended rate, fees) must appear in the borrower’s Key Facts Statement (KFS) for transparency ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Minimum Retention:** Each co-lender must retain at least 10% of every individual loan in its own books ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Funding Commitment:** The originating RE irrevocably commits the partner’s agreed share to its account (back-to-back) ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)). The loan shares must be booked in both lenders’ books within 15 calendar days of disbursement ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)). If the partner cannot take its share in 15 days, the loan remains on the originator’s books and any transfer thereafter must follow the [RBI’s Transfer of Loan Exposures (TLE) rules](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf).
 **Separate Accounts & Escrow:** Each lender keeps a separate account for its share of the borrower’s loan ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)). All disbursements and repayments between the REs and the borrower must flow through an escrow account ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Interest and Fees:** Borrowers pay a single blended interest rate, calculated as a weighted average of each RE’s internal rate based on their funding proportions ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)). Any service fees charged to the borrower are added into the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and disclosed in the KFS ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Default Loss Guarantee (DLG):** The originating RE may offer a Default Loss Guarantee up to 5% of the outstanding portfolio under CLA ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Asset Classification:** RBI mandates borrower-level classification for CLA exposures ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)). If one partner labels an account as SMA or NPA, the other must do so too, with near-real-time information sharing (latest by next working day) ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Priority Sector Treatment:** For loans eligible for priority-sector (PSL) status, each lender can claim PSL benefits for its share of the co-lent loan ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Accounting:** NBFCs must follow applicable accounting standards for CLAs. Any unrealized profit (arising from booking the co-lent share) must be deducted from Tier-1 capital or Net Owned Funds until loan maturity ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Regulatory Compliance:** Each RE must include CLAs in its internal/external audits ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)). Co-lending REs must follow RBI’s KYC norms – partner REs may rely on the originator’s KYC check for customer identification ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).
 **Disclosures:** Lenders must disclose co-lending details beyond regulatory norms: on their website they must list all active co-lending partners ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)), and in financial statements’ Notes they must report aggregate CLA data ([RBI Directions](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf)).

## Key Changes in 2025 vs. Prior Framework

The 2025 Directions introduce several major changes compared to earlier RBI guidelines (the 2018 origination circular and 2020 PSL co-lending scheme). Notably:

- **Broadening Scope:** Earlier, co-lending guidelines applied only to priority-sector lending (PSL). The new framework covers all eligible credit (retail, MSME, etc.), not just PSL [28](https://www.careratings.com/uploads/newsfiles/1755580627_Reserve%20Bank%20of%20India%20%27Co-Lending%20Arrangements%20Directions%27%202025.pdf). It also extends applicability to all regulated lenders, not just banks and NBFCs [29](https://www.crisilratings.com/en/home/newsroom/press-releases/2025/08/revised-co-lending-arrangement-directives-to-boost-transparency.html).
- **Uniform Retention:** The mandatory retention is now 10% for every RE in each loan [10](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf). The 10% floor (for both partners) creates symmetrical “skin in the game” and reduces capital held by NBFCs (lowering their capital requirement) [30](https://www.careratings.com/uploads/newsfiles/1755580627_Reserve%20Bank%20of%20India%20%27Co-Lending%20Arrangements%20Directions%27%202025.pdf).
- **Eliminating CLM‑2 Loopholes:** RBI now standardizes on CLM‑1 style co-lending. Originators must identify the partner upfront and commit funding irrevocably [12](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf). If the partner does not take its portion within 15 days, the loan cannot be resold casually but must follow the TLE mechanism [13](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf).
- **DLG Extended:** The new rules formally permit an originating RE to provide a Default Loss Guarantee (up to 5% of exposure) even for non-digital loans [19](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf), whereas earlier DLG was limited to digital lending. At the same time, subordination or waiver of fees is expressly forbidden [18](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf).
- **Interest Rate Structure:** RBI mandates a single blended interest rate for the borrower [16](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf). Previously, lenders could ostensibly charge separate rates (often making up a composite rate internally); now the borrower sees only one rate. All charges/fees must be included in the disclosed APR [17](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf).
- **Disclosure and Fair Practices:** The new directions greatly enhance borrower safeguards. Co-lending agreements and loan documents must clearly disclose partner roles and a single interface contact [8](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf). Additional disclosures via KFS are required. Escrow routing of funds and mandatory grievance mechanisms strengthen transparency and customer protection.
- **Asset Classification:** Unlike before, RBI now enforces synchronized NPA tagging across lenders [20](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf). If one lender classifies an account as SMA/NPA, the other must mirror that classification promptly [20](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf).
- **New Reporting Requirements:** RBI now explicitly requires website and financial-statement disclosures on co-lending [31](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf), which were not mandated before. This adds compliance burden but increases market transparency.
- **Accounting Treatment:** NBFCs are required to deduct any unrealised profit on co-lending from regulatory capital [22](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf) – a new prudential step ensuring capital adequacy is not overstated.

## RBI’s Rationale for the Updates

RBI’s published intent is to broaden and clarify the co-lending model. As the Directions state, in light of successful PSL co-lending experiences, RBI aims “to broaden the scope of co-lending” and issue “comprehensive revised Directions…providing specific regulatory clarity on the permissibility of such arrangements, while addressing some of the prudential as well as conduct related aspects” [3](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf). In other words, RBI wants to make co-lending a mature, mainstream tool for credit delivery (beyond just PSL targets) with clear rules.

Analysts note RBI’s objectives include reinforcing risk alignment and enhancing borrower protection as co-lending expands into retail and MSME segments. For example, RBI intends these changes to “reinforce risk alignment, ensure early stress recognition, and protect borrowers as co-lending scales” [32](https://bfsi.economictimes.indiatimes.com/articles/rbi-implements-stricter-co-lending-rules-for-banks-and-nbfcs/123145900). Lowering the retention ratio to 10% is meant to promote co-lending (by freeing up NBFC capital) while standardized rules minimize arbitrage [30](https://www.careratings.com/uploads/newsfiles/1755580627_Reserve%20Bank%20of%20India%20%27Co-Lending%20Arrangements%20Directions%27%202025.pdf). Requiring uniform NPA classification and timely share transfers is aimed at preventing hidden leverage and ensuring both lenders face the same credit risk signal [20](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf) [13](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf).

Overall, RBI’s rationale (as expressed in the Directions and accompanying commentary) is to formalize co-lending as a key credit-distribution mechanism, extend it beyond priority sectors, and tighten governance to make it safe and transparent [3](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf) [33](https://vinodkothari.com/2025/08/rbi-issues-co-lending-directions-2025/). The resulting framework is intended to help both banks and NBFCs leverage each other’s strengths (banks’ funding, NBFCs’ outreach [34](https://www.crisilratings.com/en/home/newsroom/press-releases/2025/08/revised-co-lending-arrangement-directives-to-boost-transparency.html)) while protecting end borrowers.

## Implications

### For Banks
- The new rules mean banks must maintain capital and share risks on each joint loan (never offload 100%).
- Banks gain extended reach into NBFC distribution networks and underserved borrower segments [34](https://www.crisilratings.com/en/home/newsroom/press-releases/2025/08/revised-co-lending-arrangement-directives-to-boost-transparency.html).
- Greater compliance: integrating loan data with NBFC partners, synchronizing NPA tagging [20](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf), using escrow accounts, and publishing co-lending disclosures.

### For NBFCs
- Co-lending remains very attractive to NBFCs. The lower 10% retention greatly reduces the capital NBFCs must invest per loan (versus the old 20% requirement), effectively lowering their capital charge and enabling a much larger co-lending book [30](https://www.careratings.com/uploads/newsfiles/1755580627_Reserve%20Bank%20of%20India%20%27Co-Lending%20Arrangements%20Directions%27%202025.pdf). NBFCs can leverage cheaper bank funds (and share risk) to expand lending at more affordable rates. Enhanced clarity (e.g. uniform classification, KFS disclosures) also builds investor confidence. On the flip side, NBFCs must adapt to stricter timelines and disclosures, share borrower-level data quickly with banks, and account for any unrealized profits in capital [22](https://www.fidcindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RBI-CO-LENDING-06-08-25.pdf).

### For Smaller/Non-Partnered NBFCs
- Lower entry barriers may benefit mid/small NBFCs. Industry analysts note that the reduction in required share from 20% to 10% “should particularly benefit mid‑ and smaller sized NBFCs that face higher funding constraints” [35](https://www.crisilratings.com/en/home/newsroom/press-releases/2025/08/revised-co-lending-arrangement-directives-to-boost-transparency.html). Smaller NBFCs may find it easier to attract bank partnerships under these terms. At the same time, NBFCs currently without bank tie-ups may feel competitive pressure; banks and larger NBFCs will now service more borrowers cooperatively. Non-partnered NBFCs might need to pursue their own bank alliances or risk losing market share as co-lending scales. (Conversely, the new rules bring transparency and standardization that could encourage more banks and NBFCs to partner, indirectly creating new opportunities even for smaller players.)

## Challenges and Opportunities

**Challenges:**
- The framework’s detailed requirements pose operational hurdles. Systems must be upgraded to share borrower-level data rapidly (for NPA tagging and DLG information). Co-lending partners need tight coordination (especially if using CLM‑2 structures); for example, banks must identify their partner at loan sanction and receive funding-share transfers within 15 days [36](https://www.crisilratings.com/en/home/newsroom/press-releases/2025/08/revised-co-lending-arrangement-directives-to-boost-transparency.html). Analysts warn this “heightens the need for technology integration and alignment of credit policies” [36](https://www.crisilratings.com/en/home/newsroom/press-releases/2025/08/revised-co-lending-arrangement-directives-to-boost-transparency.html). In the short term, some banks/NBFCs may find it easier to use direct assignment or traditional syndication (outside the CLA rules) during the transition [37](https://www.crisilratings.com/en/home/newsroom/press-releases/2025/08/revised-co-lending-arrangement-directives-to-boost-transparency.html). Compliance costs (audits, disclosures, KFS updates) will rise.

**Opportunities:**
- On the positive side, the updated regime deepens credit flow into underserved segments. NBFCs can now scale up lending via bank co-funding, and borrowers benefit from potentially lower blended rates and clearer terms (one rate/APR disclosed). Joint underwriting means risk is shared: banks can lend to new segments via NBFC partners, and NBFCs get access to low-cost funding. Enhanced borrower protections (single point of contact, transparent fees) may boost customer confidence. Over time, the greater transparency and formal oversight should strengthen the co-lending market, making it a resilient channel for inclusive finance. In fact, credit analysts foresee that while initial volumes may slow as systems align, co-lending could pick up strongly once banks and NBFCs adapt to the new standards [36](https://www.crisilratings.com/en/home/newsroom/press-releases/2025/08/revised-co-lending-arrangement-directives-to-boost-transparency.html).
