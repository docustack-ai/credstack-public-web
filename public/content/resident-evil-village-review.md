# Resident Evil Village review

Resident Evil Village is a direct sequel to 2017’s Resident Evil 7, but takes a very different direction to its predecessor, namely the fact that this time round instead of fighting against various mutated zombies, you’re now dealing with more occult enemies like werewolves and vampires.

## Gameplay

The gameplay is intense and atmospheric, with a strong focus on exploration and survival horror elements.

## Verdict

Outstanding entry in the Resident Evil series.
